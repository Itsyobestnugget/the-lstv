- 👋 Hi, I’m **LSTV**. I'm a student in IT and about 8 years of experience.
- 👀 I’m interested in **development and design**, and i'm working on creating a whole ecosystem.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning even more advanced JS and Figma.<br>
      But, you know, learning some new stuff everyday.
- 💞️ I love to help beginer developers get started.
- ✨ **Languages i use the most**: Hastrell, JavaScript, C++, HTML&CSS, and my own one, when it gets finished.<br>
      I dislike TypeScript, Python and Java. I'm sure i'll get a lot of people mad at me for this.<br>
